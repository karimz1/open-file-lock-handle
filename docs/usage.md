## Getting started

Run `oflh` in an interactive terminal:

```sh
oflh                          # Current directory
oflh ./build                  # Directory and its descendants
oflh ./build/plugin.dll       # One file
oflh "/path/with spaces"       # Quote paths containing spaces
```

1. Use **Processes** (`1`) to see processes referencing the target path.
2. Press `/` to search, then `Enter` to finish typing.
3. Press `Enter` on a process to inspect its individual file usages.
4. Use **Locked files** (`2`) to narrow the list to files with lock or sharing-conflict evidence.
5. Press `r` to rescan, or `a` to enable five-second auto-refresh.

The **LOCKS** column counts distinct paths with lock or sharing-conflict evidence
among each process's filtered usages. Multiple lock entries for one path count
once. `0` means no evidence was detected in those results, not proof that no lock
exists. On Windows, the reported process's ownership remains unverified. Positive
counts use muted red. Very narrow terminals retain the count and omit the path
column; press `Enter` to inspect file usages.

In process details, `r` refreshes file usages and metrics; `a` toggles the same
auto-refresh used by the main view. Both views show **MANUAL · r refresh** or
**LIVE · every 5s**, including while a scan is running. Search and lock filters
remain active.

In process details, `l` toggles **Locks only** without clearing the search. The
summary counts distinct locked paths among the displayed usages. Lock labels
appear in muted red. The selected filename appears above the table, and its full
path appears below it. Use `←` and `→` to page through a long path.

On wide terminals, the side panel shows the selected process, its ancestry,
resource usage, and path details. Compact terminals retain resource and parent
information in the process details view.

## Search

Search is case-insensitive and updates as you type. The same rules apply to
Processes, Locked files, and process details.

| Query | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `dll` | A contiguous fragment, such as the extension in `plugin.dll` |
| `MIMJWT` | Word or CamelCase prefixes in `Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens.dll` |
| `micro*dll` | Chunks `micro` and `dll`, in that order |
| `FLEC.` / `FLEC*` | Abbreviated stem in `FileLockExampleCli.dll` or `FileLockExampleCli.deps.json` |
| `FLEC*.json` | Abbreviated stem followed by a `.json` fragment |
| `*.dll` | A field containing `.dll` |
| `micro*dll mapped` | Both terms must match |

Plain terms match contiguous fragments or word/CamelCase prefixes. They do not
match arbitrary scattered letters across a path. `*` matches zero or more
characters, including path separators. Each chunk between wildcards supports
the same fragment and abbreviation matching. Punctuation remains literal, so
`FLEC.` requires a dot after the abbreviated stem. Patterns can match anywhere in a field;
`*.dll` is not restricted to a filename ending in `.dll`.

Filename and process-name matches rank above directory-only matches. Choosing
an explicit sort order, such as CPU or PID, overrides relevance ordering.

The matched path and `+N` count follow the active filter. When you open process
details, file-related terms carry into the details search. Process-only terms,
such as a PID, stay in the main search. Press `Esc` in details to clear its search
and see all usages again.

## Process actions

Press `Space` to select processes, or `Ctrl+A` to select or deselect all visible
processes. Selections survive filtering, so a selection may include processes
that are no longer visible.

- `k` requests normal termination of the selection, or the current process if nothing is selected.
- `x` force kills the same targets.
- Every action requires confirmation, with **Cancel** selected by default. The dialog lists the targets, including hidden selections.

To act on a parent, press `Tab` or `→` to focus the ancestry tree. It initially
selects the current process. Use `↑` to move toward its parents and `↓` to return
toward the current process. Here, `k` and `x` apply only to the highlighted tree
node, regardless of selections in the main list.

The tree retains its captured process identities across refreshes. Before
termination, the backend revalidates the target to guard against PID reuse.
Protected processes and ancestors without an available identity cannot be
stopped. A successful termination request returns focus to the results and
refreshes the list.

Stopping a parent may close its application and affect its children. It does not
recursively terminate the entire tree. `oflh` does not directly unlock files;
terminating a process may release the resources it holds.

## Keyboard reference

| Context | Key | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main view | `1` / `2` | Processes / Locked files |
| Lists | `↑` / `↓` | Move selection |
| Main view | `Enter` | Inspect process usages |
| Main view or details | `/` | Start search |
| Search input | `Enter` / `Esc` | Apply / cancel editing |
| Main view | `Space` | Select or deselect process |
| Main view | `Ctrl+A` | Select or deselect all visible processes |
| Process actions | `k` / `x` | Normal termination / force kill |
| Main view | `K` / `X` | Act on selection, or all filtered processes if none selected |
| Main view or details | `r` / `a` | Refresh / toggle auto-refresh |
| Main view | `n` / `p` | Sort by name / PID |
| Main view | `m` / `c` | Sort by RAM / CPU, highest first |
| Main view | `i` | Toggle side panel |
| Main view | `Tab` / `→` | Focus ancestry tree |
| Ancestry tree | `Tab` / `←` / `Esc` | Return to results |
| Ancestry tree | `Home` / `End` | Select root / current process |
| Process details | `l` | Toggle Locks only |
| Process details | `←` / `→` | Page through selected path |
| Navigation | `Esc` | Clear search, cancel, or go back |
| Navigation | `?` | Show help |
| Navigation | `R` / `D` | Open repository / donation page in your default browser |
| Navigation | `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Back / quit |

Only `1` and `2` switch tabs. `Tab` changes table/tree focus or selects a dialog
action. Selected **Cancel** has a green background; selected **Terminate** or
**Force kill** has a red background. A pointer also identifies the choice, and
Cancel remains the default. `R` and `D` open GitHub and Donate; Help shows both
URLs near the top. While editing a search, it stays in the search input.

## Terminal support

Use an interactive terminal with Unicode and true-color support. A wider window
provides room for the process table and side panel. No particular terminal
emulator is required.
