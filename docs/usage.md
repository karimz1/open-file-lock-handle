[Back to the README](../README.md) · [Platform behavior](platform-support.md)

## Getting started

Run `oflh` in an interactive terminal:

```sh
oflh                          # Current directory
oflh ./build                  # Directory and its descendants
oflh ./build/plugin.dll       # One file
oflh "/path/with spaces"       # Quote paths containing spaces
```

1. Use **Processes** (`1`) to see processes referencing the target path.
2. Press `/` to search, then `Enter` to finish typing.
3. Press `Enter` on a process to inspect its individual file usages.
4. Use **Locked files** (`2`) to narrow the list to files with lock or sharing-conflict evidence.
5. Press `r` to rescan, or `a` to enable five-second auto-refresh.

In process details, `r` refreshes file usages and metrics; `a` toggles the same
auto-refresh used by the main view. Search and lock filters remain active.

In process details, `l` toggles **Locks only** without clearing the search. The
summary counts distinct locked paths among the displayed usages. Lock labels
appear in muted red. The selected filename appears above the table, and its full
path appears below it. Use `←` and `→` to page through a long path.

On wide terminals, the side panel shows the selected process, its ancestry,
resource usage, and path details. Compact terminals retain resource and parent
information in the process details view.

## Ports

Press `3` for **Ports**, or start directly with `oflh --ports`. The default is all
visible local bindings. Press `s` to show only ports of processes associated with
the target path, or start with `oflh --here .`. File and port search text are
independent, so switching tabs does not mix their filters.

| Query | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `50` | Port numbers containing 50, such as 5040; updates while typing |
| `port:3000` | Exact local port; does not match `13000` or a PID |
| `tcp port:3000` | TCP listeners on port 3000 |
| `udp` | Bound UDP sockets |
| `ipv6` | IPv6 bindings |
| `127.0.0.1` | Bindings matching that address |
| `pid:424242` | Search the process ID explicitly |
| `node port:3000` | Both the process text and exact port must match |

Exact port numbers must be between 1 and 65535. Bare digits match a contiguous
part of the local port number, independently of PIDs and addresses. Other text uses the fragment and
wildcard rules below. Each address/protocol/port binding has its own row; IPv4
and IPv6 bindings remain separate. The initial order is by port number.

**THIS PATH** means the process has an observed file, executable, mapping, or
working-directory reference matching the target. It is an association, not proof
that a particular project created the socket. Scope follows the original target,
not the search text in the Processes tab. Windows cannot inspect working
directories through the current backend; interpreted development servers may
therefore appear only in ALL PORTS. See [platform coverage](platform-support.md#ports).

`Enter` opens the selected process's ports; `f` switches to its target-matching
file usages and back. `Esc` returns to the originating tab directly unless you
switched with `f`; then it returns to the original detail view first. Opening
port details from Ports never requires a detour through files. The main search
and selected binding are preserved.
`q` quits from any screen outside search editing; `Ctrl+C` always quits. `/` searches within details. `r` refreshes and `a` toggles
five-second auto-refresh. Port details display LIVE or MANUAL mode.

Socket discovery runs with the initial scan and subsequent refreshes. The Processes
view shows a PORTS binding count; the side panel and file details preview distinct
protocol/port pairs. IPv4 and IPv6 bindings count separately in the table. Press
Enter, then `f`, to inspect all addresses. Counts describe the whole process,
independent of the file search filter. Zero means none detected, not proof of absence. An entry marked **owner unavailable** has no
verified PID and cannot be terminated. Selecting multiple bindings of the same
process produces one termination target. Selections survive scope and tab changes;
confirmation includes hidden selections, as it does for file results.

## Search

Search is case-insensitive and updates as you type. The same rules apply to
Processes, Locked files, and file-usage details. Ports use partial numeric matching and explicit exact port terms as described above.

| Query | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `dll` | A contiguous fragment, such as the extension in `plugin.dll` |
| `MIMJWT` | Word or CamelCase prefixes in `Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens.dll` |
| `micro*dll` | Chunks `micro` and `dll`, in that order |
| `FLEC.` / `FLEC*` | Abbreviated stem in `FileLockExampleCli.dll` or `FileLockExampleCli.deps.json` |
| `FLEC*.json` | Abbreviated stem followed by a `.json` fragment |
| `*.dll` | A field containing `.dll` |
| `micro*dll mapped` | Both terms must match |

Plain terms match contiguous fragments or word/CamelCase prefixes. They do not
match arbitrary scattered letters across a path. `*` matches zero or more
characters, including path separators. Each chunk between wildcards supports
the same fragment and abbreviation matching. Punctuation remains literal, so
`FLEC.` requires a dot after the abbreviated stem. Patterns can match anywhere in a field;
`*.dll` is not restricted to a filename ending in `.dll`.

Filename and process-name matches rank above directory-only matches. Choosing
an explicit sort order, such as CPU or PID, overrides relevance ordering.

The matched path and `+N` count follow the active filter. When you open process
details, file-related terms carry into the details search. Process-only terms,
such as a PID, stay in the main search. To see all usages again, press `/`, `Ctrl+U`, then `Enter` to clear the detail search.
Outside search editing, `Esc` retraces detail navigation as described above.

## Process actions

Press `Space` to select processes, or `Ctrl+A` to select or deselect all visible
processes. Selections survive filtering, so a selection may include processes
that are no longer visible.

- `k` requests normal termination of the selection, or the current process if nothing is selected.
- `x` force kills the same targets.
- Every action requires confirmation, with **Cancel** selected by default. The dialog lists the targets, including hidden selections.

To act on a parent, press `Tab` or `→` to focus the ancestry tree. It initially
selects the current process. Use `↑` to move toward its parents and `↓` to return
toward the current process. Here, `k` and `x` apply only to the highlighted tree
node, regardless of selections in the main list.

The tree retains its captured process identities across refreshes. Before
termination, the backend revalidates the target to guard against PID reuse.
Protected processes and ancestors without an available identity cannot be
stopped. A successful termination request returns focus to the results and
refreshes the list.

Stopping a parent may close its application and affect its children. It does not
recursively terminate the entire tree. `oflh` does not directly unlock files;
terminating a process may release the resources it holds.

Only `1`, `2`, and `3` switch tabs. `Tab` changes table/tree focus or selects a dialog
action. Selected **Cancel** has a green background; selected **Terminate** or
**Force kill** has a red background. A pointer also identifies the choice, and
Cancel remains the default. `R` and `D` open GitHub and Donate; Help shows both
URLs near the top. While editing a search, it stays in the search input.

## Terminal support

Use an interactive terminal with Unicode and true-color support. A wider window
provides room for the process table and side panel. No particular terminal
emulator is required.
